# XamarinApp
Project to practice and learn Xamarin

In this project I've created an mobile app to make car reservations using Xamarin Framework.
You can run it in your machine making a clone of the project and opening in Visual Studio (I recommend Visual Studio 2019 or low versions because of compability)
